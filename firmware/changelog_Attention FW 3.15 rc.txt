Motion4Sim


Version 3.15 release candidate for stable

- lcd init problems fixed everything else seems to emi related
- lcd only comes to garbled char when workhour timer is active (normaly deactivated)
- long press (5s) of encoder button does a lcd screen init
- double click feature for encoder button
	-> fast double click switches main screen from 
		gain"100%" -> "Sp Win" Spike Window -> "Belt" retreat -> "Filter" Emalp value back to gain
	-> you can change value with encoder turning left or right
	-> values were not saved to eeprom
	-> for saving go to menu "Save and return"
	-> with double click you can also leave any menu back to main screen with no saving
- new Spike Filter design
	
	defined with 3 Values.
	
		Menu -> Filter 	-> Spike Filter 	
				-> Spike Window
				-> Sp.Filter smooth


	-> Spike Window:  from 1...400% (or more) 100%  is 1/4 actuator range in pulses
    	 	-this means if pulse input is more than say 100% (1/4 of actuator stroke) Spike is detected
		-pulsestrain is cut/limited to Spike window size pulsecount
	-> Spike Filter: 
 		- after Spike detection the Emalp(normal Filter) raises every frame(2ms) Spikestrength value is lowpass over raising emalp	
		-> this means lower value faster growing Filter (after spike slower return to normal motion)
		-> higher value ,lower growing filter ( after spike faster return to normal motion)
	-> Sp. Filter smooth:  when spike is finished (pulsetrain smaller as Spike Window)
		-> dyn Emalp filter decreases(2ms) with  Sp.Filter smooth ( Emalp over decr. value) 
		-> this means higher value slower decrease and slower return to normal motion
		-> and vice versa
	
	//for me follwing values have worked
	//Spikestrength = 20 to 80  (higher means more smooth in spike)
	//Spikewindow from 10%  for racing 20-40 % for flying  (higher means later spike detection)
	//Spike smooth 2-10   (higher means longer of spike smoothing ,do not use 1 never ending spike)
