Motion4Sim M4S Controller Firmware


Version v3.32 fix1

- fixed online bt setup when using dashboard for config
- limit mastergain in factory setting to 100%
- fixed go online after homing command

Version v3.32
- factory reset required after flashing!!!
- added support for latching and fixed Online switch Buttons .. only in controller Setup Menu
- hwpulsing now always activ when supported, pcb version >1.08 
- major changes to pulse engine
- doubled pulse & inverse kinematics rate from 500/s to 1000/s
- also filters calculation rate now from 2ms to 1ms  -> filter behaviour may change adjust values
- removed usb data timing jitter complete

Version v3.30

- factory reset required after flashing!!!
- added Actuator Input Data matrix, 
- so you can use SRS or Simtools Actuator order without reconnecting cables
- edit via Handheld in Actuators menu or use Dashboard in Filter tab
- only for direct mode!
- in position mode you will need still clockwise actuator connection starting with 1 at front left actuator 
- fixed shutdown function torque recognition and not rebooting
- fixed service menu torque recognition

Version 3.29

- added separate fifo for usb motion and data
- in principle, both USB ports can be operated in parallel
  need to test what happens when Motion data is received on both ports
  so be carefull using it
- changed debouncing for killswitch and online switch
- improvement of serial pattern detection
- added SimHub  support

Version 3.28 

- added message crc datachecks to all communication 
- the end chars 0x0a 0x0d are replaced with crc16 checksumm
- still back compatible to 0x0a 0x0d if send to recieve but sends only with crc so older dashboard will not recieve data
- update to Dashboard Version 3.28
- works only full with Dashboard >=v3.28 because crc checks
- fixed motionusb port problems


Version 3.26

- just for testing fw updates with flypt

Version 3.25 fix1

- fixed  short brake release impulse when startup with EM Button engaged
- fixed  online speed set to 50khz only in some conditions


Version 3.25 

- hardware pulsing is stable now ,just enable, works same, read advice in dashboard
- small change to break release delaytiming
- new spike algorithm is now implemented 
	-> adjust spikwindow for setup from smaller value to higher
	-> read also fw3.15 release note down this list
- old spike is emalp+spike2 option now in filter setting
- changed lowspeed in factory settings
- changed breakdelay to 100ms in factory settings
- @dureiken changed factory setting motionxp for spike to spike2 and cal/lowspeed settings
- no changes to dashboard made same version 

Version 3.24 

- a lot of changes test your rig behaviour before pratical use!!
- added new EM Button debouncing with Software and Hardware
- added prompt ">" for Setup and Configuration values
- fixed flashport at startup wrong config  data transmission 
- added transition to standby with special triple emalp filtering, 
	-> also into motion from standby uses now this transition
	-> setup transition speed for this its in seconds
- maybe for better transition adjust the low speed to 5000*10hz in setup (Speed from/to Standby Position)
	-> this also changes auto homeing speed for belt
- hardcoded service speed set to 1000x10hz before was low speed too
- extra01 pin is now low at startup in case for brake nc use
- controller firmware reset, now only possible in save rig states
- dashboard controls "transmit"  accepted only when restart/offline phase possible
- fixing service menu emergency issues
- changed doubleclick recognition speed a little bit faster 
- fixed belt spike2 problem (no spike calculation for belt)
- removed doubleclick feature in the menu

Version 3.20

-  removed motionsystem introduced in 3.10 -> done by Dashboard now
-  added support for flash-usb port for motion and dashboard use
-> i recommend this port now for all operations
-  added hw pulsing support for pcb version from 1.09 (could double resolution)
-  added option for inoffz. srs supp with native usbport mod
-  added support for new motioncueingsystem included in dashboard now
-  this fw operates only with dashboard version 3.20 
-  added realtime belt retreat modification 
-  added adjust.servobrake switching delay


Version 3.15 

- lcd init problems fixed everything else seems to emi related
- lcd only comes to garbled char when workhour timer is active (normaly deactivated)
- option in menu -> setup -> Mastergain enabl : if set to off Mastergain is fixed on main screen
- long press (>3s) of encoder button does a lcd screen init
- double click feature for encoder button
	-> fast double click switches main screen from 
		gain"100%" -> "Sp Win" Spike Window -> "Belt" retreat -> "Filter" Emalp value back to gain
	-> you can change value with encoder turning left or right
	-> values were not saved to eeprom
	-> for saving go to menu "Save and return"
	-> with double click you can also leave any menu back to main screen with no saving
- new Spike Filter design
	
	defined with 3 Values.
	
		Menu -> Filter 	-> Spike Filter 	
				-> Spike Window
				-> Sp.Filter smooth


	-> Spike Window:  from 1...400% (or more) 100%  is 1/4 actuator range in pulses
    	 	-this means if pulse input is more than say 100% (1/4 of actuator stroke) Spike is detected
		-pulsestrain is cut/limited to Spike window size pulsecount
	-> Spike Filter: 
 		- after Spike detection the Emalp(normal Filter) raises every frame(2ms) Spikestrength value is lowpass over raising emalp	
		-> this means lower value faster growing Filter (after spike slower return to normal motion)
		-> higher value ,lower growing filter ( after spike faster return to normal motion)
	-> Sp. Filter smooth:  when spike is finished (pulsetrain smaller as Spike Window)
		-> dyn Emalp filter decreases(2ms) with  Sp.Filter smooth ( Emalp over decr. value) 
		-> this means higher value slower decrease and slower return to normal motion
		-> and vice versa
	
	//for me follwing values have worked
	//Spikestrength = 20 to 80  (higher means more smooth in spike)
	//Spikewindow from 10%  for racing 20-40 % for flying  (higher means later spike detection)
	//Spike smooth 2-10   (higher means longer of spike smoothing ,do not use 1 never ending spike)
